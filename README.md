Auto Add program for contacts gathered through Google spreadsheets

This is a very specific single purpose program, and probably not even written that well. But, if by some chance someone has a similar need then by all means take a look, and partake^^
The simple rundown of this program is that it finds a name and a number input into a Google spreadsheet, and then adds those automatically to your contacts. Still kind of a WIP~
