What will happen to my personal information?
Auto Add does not look at, gather, or try to access any personal data in any way aside from the user's email address. It does this to know which account it will assign a new contact to.

What does it do specifically?
Auto Add will activate upon edit to fetch the name and number for a new contact. It then reformats the data and adds it to the user's contacts list.

Other
Auto Add does not share this information with others and has no other purpose but to add contacts with ease. If you have any questions, email: timthebaker115@gmail.com
